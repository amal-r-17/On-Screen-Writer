# On-Screen-Writer
A tool to help you write on the screen of a live stream with hand gesture.
This tool will allow you to write on a live streaming screen with just your hand getures in the air.

The tool works by tracking an object with a particular color. This is done by using the HSV color space.

Here I am tracking a pink color to make the drawing on the live camera feed window(Web cam feed).

We can make the code track any color my providing the lower and upper bounds of that particular colour. This can be found out by a samll program that I have provided here as well.
